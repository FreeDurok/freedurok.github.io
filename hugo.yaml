      Cyber Security guy with a thing for researching threats, breaking things ethically, and automating whatever feels repetitive.
      I get completely absorbed when something sparks my curiosity and I enjoy going deep until I figure it out.
      In my spare time I tinker with code, stay loyal to Bitcoin, and love working with sharp minds in collaborative environments.
